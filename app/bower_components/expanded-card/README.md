# &lt;expanded-card&gt;

#### _This element was used for an individual project which has now been completed. I do not intend to work on this any further, however any pull requests are welcome._

This Polymer element  is designed to be used inside of paper-material as a card and displays a [paper-icon-button](https://elements.polymer-project.org/elements/paper-icon-button) with an expand icon. The element also wraps the content that appears when expanded using [iron-collapse](https://elements.polymer-project.org/elements/iron-collapse). A rotation animation is also displayed when the expansion icon is pressed using [neon-animation](https://elements.polymer-project.org/elements/neon-animation)
